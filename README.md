# pentest-as-a-container
No Linux or Linux VM available? Spin up a container and go pentesting.

I like to keep my data that I use for CTF and pentesting related stuff separated from the environment that I call daily driver. Usually I used a dedicated VM (Kali) for that.

When I got my macbook with M1 cpu (Jun 2021) I learned very quick that there is no easy way to use virtual machines. 

Time to go all in into containerization.

Run a container with X11 support to run Burp and Browser out off the container / terminal along with the most common terminal tools.

## When running on a mac:

install xquartz (restart the mac)

run on your mac: xhost +  or xhost local:root

clone project

create ssh keys in the repo folder (default name for keys: container_pete

## build
docker build . -t pete

## run
docker run -v '~/.vpn':'/home/pete/.vpn' --cap-add=NET_ADMIN --device /dev/net/tun --sysctl net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6=0 -p 4455:22 -d pete

## connect
ssh -X -R 6000:localhost:6000 -L 8080:localhost:8080 -p 4455 pete@localhost -i container_pete -v
